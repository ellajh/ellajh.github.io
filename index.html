          <h3>BIO</h3>
          <p>
            I grew up in a small town in the South West of the UK. I was very keen on music, and spent lots of time learning the piano (quite well) and the violin (badly). Playing in my town and county youth orchestras led me to take a Music degree at the University of Birmingham, where I studied subjects as diverse as the origins of hip hop, medieval tonal harmony, and the use of sound design to build community in video games. Unsurprisingly, none of this has yet proved very useful in the real world, so after finishing my undergraduate degree I applied to study for an MA in Creative Media Industries: Cultural Management at London South Bank University.

            The MA covered hugely interesting (and head-achingly difficult) aspects of cultural theory, as well as practical research and project development skills. I was interested particularly in the ways we experience and access art, and for my final research project I produced an exhibition of edible art. Since graduating, I’ve continued to work in the creative industries on some diverse and exciting projects. In my spare time, I enjoy improving my (terrible) French, practicing the piano, and learning to program. I started teaching myself to code on and off in 2015, beginning with Processing and since going on to have a crack at Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. To give my brain a break from all the learning, I also volunteer as a Project Leader with Foodcycle, a fantastic charity that takes surplus food and uses it to cook free meals for local communities. (We are always looking for new volunteers across London, even during the pandemic - join us <a href="https://www.foodcycle.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer/"><b>here!</b></a>)

          Since graduating, I’ve worked for three large organisations. Between 2017 and 2019 I worked as Projects Officer for the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE), a job which took me touring with the orchestra all over the world, to Malta, Poland, France, Czech Republic, and Austria, to name a few. Being privy to rehearsals with some of the world’s most fantastic musicians, in some of the world’s most incredible concert halls was an absolutely incredible experience. The OAE is a period instrument orchestra, so along with learning lots about the managing cultural programmes and producing tours, I learned a lot about the weird and wonderful quirks of ancient instruments, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVabz8LneI4&t=16s"><b>theorbo</b></a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPvpyI-bmEM&t=66s"><b>oboe da caccia</b></a>. I was also responsible for administering the OAE’s Experience Scheme for emerging musicians, a programme developed for young musicians in the field of historically informed practice to gain experience with the orchestra. This was an especial highlight, as it was fantastic to help young people find their place in the music industry, and watch them progress into the main orchestra.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also worked for two international creative production agencies, which made for a fantastic and rigorous education in managing projects in super high-pressure, high-scrutiny conditions. It’s helped me get really good at drawing up project schedules, creating and managing sensible project budgets, and negotiating with suppliers, clients, and teams. It’s been great to be able to apply these skills to all areas of my life, from helping plan Foodcycle projects to managing my own programming learning better. I love seeing a project through from conception to execution, and it’s fantastic to have the tools and skills to be able to do this to really high standards.

          Since almost wiping the family iMac when I accidentally accessed the recovery boot menu as a 7 year old in the 90’s, I’ve been interested in what goes on behind the screen. Something I’ve noticed while working in the arts and creative industries is how well placed the sector is to take advantage of new technology, and how collaborative platforms, communication software, and the web can have an especially significant impact on the sharing and accessing of arts and culture. I feel very strongly about the importance of access to arts and culture for everyone, and I would love to explore how technology can be used to further this goal.

            I’ve enjoyed getting my teeth into all the coding languages I’ve tried, but I especially love how responsive and collaborative web development can be, and I’m fascinated by its ability to reintroduce some of the connecting benefits of community into the globalised world we live in. I found it really interesting to design my website with the user experience at the forefront of my mind, and this approach has made me think much more deeply about the ways web development might be able to meet the needs of people and groups.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d love to get good enough to be able to use my skills working in support of brilliant causes that improve peoples’ lives. I’m attracted by Founders and Coders’ ethos of positive impact and inclusion, and am excited by the prospect of collaborating with others who have creative ideas about how to use technology in inspiring and productive ways. I hope that I can put my project management skills and background in arts and culture to use, and will be really interested to find out how others’ backgrounds inform their learning and ideas. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Although programming might seem quite different from my previous jobs, I’ve come to think that the reasons I enjoy them are very similar. I love building things; coming up with a project idea and chipping away at it as I watch it come to fruition. Part of the reason I’ve been successful in previous jobs involving project management is because I love the challenge of problem solving, and so I wasn’t too surprised to discover that I really enjoy the debugging process, and how much satisfaction comes from fixing a really obscure error in my code (although I won’t deny that there may be some complaining at the computer along the way!).

            I love learning, and spend a lot of my time teaching myself new skills. For a lot of things - piano, cooking, languages, this way of learning can make sense, but I have increasingly been feeling that this way of learning doesn’t work for coding. Programming on your own can only take you so far, and all the most interesting applications of code are collaborations, so it seems that learning with others, and benefitting from others' experiences and backgrounds is a much more authentic and productive way to learn.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m excited by the prospect of peer led learning, and would love to see this model become more prevalent. University can be a brilliant way to learn, but it is a large financial investment which can be a barrier and can easily become a source of regret, especially when the majority of students choose which subject to study when they are only 17! I'm totally sold on the idea that increasing the availability of alternatives, and changing the model of learning to foster a more collaborative approach is a really valuable change to contribute to and be part of.

        <h3>The Javascript</h3>
        <p>
          For my main piece of Javascript programming, I wanted to have a custom ‘feed’, that would allow me to post links to other things on the internet that I liked, a track on Spotify, a useful programming resource, a recipe I’ve been enjoying, etc., and present these in a way that would provide an accessible and fun browsing experience for the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the website’s future in mind, I wanted to come up with a system that would make posting things on the feed as low-effort as possible, to maximise the chance that I’d continue using this feature in the future. I envisioned writing some code that would allow me to call a function, with the link to the resource I wanted to share and an accompanying caption as the arguments. The idea was that this code would access the link, fetch the necessary elements from the page’s code, and return an object containing an image, hyperlink, and caption that would be automatically added to my feed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly I realised that this was not easy. I ran into problems with CORS and permissions, and couldn’t work out how to get around this in vanilla Javascript. For a while I got excited about the idea of using website APIs, but not all sites have APIs, and not all APIs would even allow me to scrape the elements I wanted. Plus, this was all really hard, and this was before I had even considered copyright issues when downloading images! Some websites have much more layman friendly APIs that allow users to grab an embed link, so I’ve used Spotify embeds in my feed because I am (pretty) sure that this doesn’t break any copyright rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, because I still really liked the idea of the feed, I settled on a bit of ‘hacky’ way of posting links to other websites. I find a royalty free image on the internet that’s relevant to the link I want to share, and run that through my function with a link and a caption, turning the image into a hyperlink to the resource I want to share. It’s not so elegant in this form, but I think it still provides value for visitors to the site, and retains the spirit of my original plan while I take some time to learn more about CORS and copyright and embedding. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page4-content-b grid-content">
        <h3> Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Before even creating index.html I grabbed a pen and paper, and sketched a very rough framework for what I wanted the website to look like. Although I suspected that things would change as I went along, like any coding project or creative project (let alone a combination of the two!), it was important to understand how I wanted it to look so that I could begin writing the HTML and CSS with the right structures in mind. Before adding any content, I created div elements to build the main sections of my front page, and wrote corresponding CSS to give the page a grid layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this point, it was easy to begin to add content, and to add subdivisions to my main grid areas. I knew that I wanted several ‘pages’, so that the user could scroll between sections, but I focused on creating my front page first as I knew I was likely to be able to copy and paste this code for the additional pages. As my layout grew in complexity, and I started using flexboxes within grid elements and vice versa, I found it invaluable to use the border property to give my elements borders. This created a kind of scaffold, and by changing the colour of border lines for various elements I was able to troubleshoot and debug a lot of problems that I had with the layout along the way. It really helped me better understand how different elements behave in the context of their parent and/or siblings and children.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page4-content-c grid-content">
        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          At the beginning, the challenge of making the website was already pretty big, so I was focusing more on getting something that looked like a website to work, rather than about incorporating responsive design right from the start. Fortunately, using lots of flexboxes and grids meant that the site was pretty responsive anyway, as these layouts handle changing size really well on their own. I wanted to base the behaviour of the layout on the size of the window only, instead of planning for individual devices (as that seemed like far too much work!), and this turned out to be the most logical approach and ensured that my design worked well on all devices anyway!
        </p>
        <p>
          I generally use the capabilities of flexboxes to handle responsiveness, including properties like flex-wrap and flex-shrink, and using vh and vw units. I have also used a fair amount of media queries too, but mostly these work in tandem with my flexboxes, and usually exist in order to set lower or upper limits on the changing size of elements, as well as to help ensure that my sidebar always behaves in a way that is sensible for the user.

          <h3>For the Future</h3>
        <p>
          I am really looking forward to applying everything I’ve learned to the next website I will build. I am proud of what I have created this time around, but I will do things very differently next time! Now that I understand much more about responsive design, I will be able to have this in mind throughout the process, and it will inform the way I design the layout from the beginning. I would definitely like to challenge myself to use fewer media queries. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also quite a lot of different places in the code that control my sidebar, and I wonder if I could design the sidebar so that I can control it to the same effect without using so much code. I think that having a better general understanding of how to control elements using CSS, Javascript and media queries will allow me to plan elements like this much more efficiently next time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d also like to learn more about accessibility. I briefly thought about adding text-to-speech capability to my website that would allow the content to be read out; I backtracked quickly when I realised how complicated that would be compared to my level of knowledge, but it is something I would love to try for next time. I tried to make sure all my div Id and class names were descriptive and helpful, but it would also be great to learn more about all the less obvious ways I can make websites friendly for all users.

          <h3>Using GIT</h3>
        <p>
          Git was a sharp learning curve, but I’m now fully sold on its usefulness. At some point it clicked, and though I’m yet to use it to work collaboratively, I can see how it will make working with others infinitely more clear. Quite early on, I used Git to restore my project to a certain point, having done something (still don’t know what!) to break my layout.  This restoration initially got me in a bit of a tangle, and I ended up with my local and online repositories getting out of sync, but with a bit of help I ensured that I pushed the right version, and created my first branch without overwriting any work.
