          I grew up in the heart of the cotswolds, surrounded by fields, woods, and a lot of cows. When I wasn’t being dragged kicking and screaming on long walks, I spent most of my childhood reading, learning the piano and the violin, and dabbling unsuccessfully in the mandolin. I played in my town and county youth orchestras which sparked an obsession with music, leading me to study Music at the University of Birmingham. At university, I studied subjects as diverse as the origins of hip hop, medieval tonal harmony, and the use of sound design to community in video games. Unsurprisingly, none of this has yet proved very useful in the real world, so after finishing my undergraduate degree I applied to study for an MA in Creative Media Industries: Cultural Management at London South Bank University.

          Building on my aptitude for getting things done and my fascination with arts and culture, the MBA at LSBU furnished me with the skills and knowledge to get into production within the creative industries. The course covered hugely interesting (and head-achingly difficult!) aspects of cultural theory, as well as practical research and project skills. Since then, I’ve worked in project management in the Arts and Creative Industries on some diverse and exciting projects. In my spare time, I work on practicing my French, which is currently somewhere on the spectrum between terrible and fluent. I began teaching myself to code on and off in 2015, beginning with Processing and since having had a crack at Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. Usually, the spare brainpower I have between finishing work and falling asleep is put to use working on learning a new programming concept.
